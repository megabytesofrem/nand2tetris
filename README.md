# nand2tetris
My descent down the Nand2Tetris rabbit hole.

## Structure
`projects` contains 13 projects ranging from simple logic gates, to an entire OS that are meant to be completed as part of the Nand2Tetris course/book.

`tools` includes useful tools like an assembler and compiler for the custom languages etc.
